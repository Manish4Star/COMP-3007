Question 4:
*************
a)Write a predicate to find the last element of a list. You may not use the built in last predicate in your answer.

exp: X=today
result: X=today.

?- mylast(X,[my,name,is,mustafa]).
exp: X = mustafa ;
result: X = mustafa.

b)Write a predicate after(X,List,Result) that returns everything in a list after any occurrence of the given element X.
?- after(a,[b,a,x,d,a,f,g],R).
R = [x, d, a, f, g] ;
R = [f, g] ;


?- after(c,[c,f,g,r,t,x,c,g,c,g],R).
R = [f, g, r, t, x, c, g, c, g] ;

c)Write a predicate nextto(X, Y, L), that succeeds when elements X and Y are immediately consecutive elements of a list L.
?- nextto(a,b,[c,a,b,d]).
true.

?- nextto(a,b,[c,b,a,d]).
false.

?- nextto(g,h,[k,l,m,g,l,h]).
false.

?- nextto(g,h,[k,l,m,g,h,h]).
true.

d) Write the predicate occurs_at_position(Element, List, Position), that allows access to the nth element in a list.
?- occurs_at_position(x, [a,b,c,x,x,d,e], 4).
true.

?- occurs_at_position(x, [a,b,c,x,x,d,e],Pos).

**************
Question 5:
**************
a) Write a predicate myAppend(L1,L2,L3) to append 2 lists (order is important, you may not use the built in append).
?- myAppend([a,b],[c,d],L).
L = [a,b,c,d].

?- myAppend([mustafa,awais,cat],[jesus,muhammad,allah],Newlist).
Newlist = [mustafa, awais, cat, jesus, muhammad, allah].

b) Rewrite the predicate myLast(X,L) from the previous question using append.
?- myLast(Last, [my,name,is,mustafa]).
Last = [my, name, is, mustafa] ;
Last = [name, is, mustafa] ;
Last = [is, mustafa] ;
Last = [mustafa] ;
Last = [] 

?- myLast(Last, [mustafa]).
Last = [mustafa] .

C) Rewrite the predicate nextto(X,Y,L) from the previous question using append.
?- nextto(a,b,[c,a,b,d]).
true.

?- nextto(a,b,[c,b,a,d]).
false.

?- nextto(g,h,[k,l,m,g,l,h]).
false.

?- nextto(g,h,[k,l,m,g,h,h]).
true.

d) Write a predicate myReverse(L1,L2) that succeeds when the result of reversing the elements of list L1 is the list L2. Your answer should use append, and may not make use of the built in reverse predicate.
?- myReverse([mustafa,awais,cat],[jesus,muhammad,allah]).
false.

?- myReverse([mustafa,awais,cat],[cat,awais,mustafa]).
true.


**************************************************************************************
Question 6:  Suppose we represent a directed graph by an edge relation:

edge(X,Y,L) %the edge from X to Y is of length L.
Therefore, a graph that looks like a square of size 2 can be defined as follows:
edge(a,b,2).
edge(b,c,2).
edge(c,d,2).
edge(a,d,2).
***************************************************************************************
a) Write and test the clauses for the relation:
connected(X,Y) %there is a path from X to Y in the graph.
?- connected(a,c).
true.

b)Write and test the clauses for the relation:
pathLength(X,Y,R) %the length of the path from X to Y is R

?- pathLength(a,d,R).
R = 2 ;
R = 6 .
